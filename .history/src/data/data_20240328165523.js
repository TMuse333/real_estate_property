      description:`Since September 2021 I have made a very strong effort to improve my ability to focus on a single task for many hours a day, everyday.
      I live a lifestyle that is based around me being able to produce my best work and to have a high attention span which can be quite difficult in todays world.
      Everyday I code for 4 hours after I wake up by setting a timer for generally 4 1 hour sessions and going for 10 minute walks in between.
      I have been doing this with react js exclusively for since july 2023 so I have amassed a lot of experience in react.
      Outside of coding hours I engage in other high qualities that require focus
      as well such as mediation, gym and reading everyday.
      I also highly limit activities that would hinder my focus such as
      watching lots of short form content or social media, which I limit to
      approximately an hour a day.`
